Music has always been an artistic expression and a medium for social commentary.
It conveys the cultural, social and emotional undertones of the era.
One of the most common statements made in debates about music is that “the music of our era is much better”. 
However, this statement is highly subjective and can only be verified through empirical analysis. 
Our goal in this project is to comprehensively analyze how music lyrics have changed over time.
We will focus on a particular genre of music. 
In order to gain insight into this fascinating aspect of music culture, we will collect, clean and analyze song lyrics systematically.
